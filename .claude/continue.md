Continue implementing and improving this project. When you create new functionality, make sure you cover everything with tests (unit, integration, end-to-end). If some tests fail, fix them - there must be no failing tests at any point of time. You can get creative with improvements but make sure the core functionality always works. Make sure the code is runnable by checking it Playwright. It should be fast to load and fast to react to my actions.
